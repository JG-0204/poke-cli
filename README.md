# Description

A simple cli app created with nodejs and PokeAPI. It asks for a pokemon name and displays some of it's information.

# Install

this project doesn't really need anything like this so I'll just do this for practice

**Clone the repository.**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:JG-0204/poke-cli.git
```

**Then install all of the project's dependencies.**

```sh
npm install
```

**Run the app using this command**

```sh
./index.js
```
